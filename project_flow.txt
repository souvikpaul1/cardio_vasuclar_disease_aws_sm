PCA - Dimenstionality reduction
XG-boost to perform classification task

1. Project Overview:

The aim of the Classification project is to detect the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease in person based on given features.

Age
Height
Gender
Smoking
Alcohol intake
Physical activity
systolic blood pressure
Diastolic blood pressure
Cholesterol
Glucose

conda activate cardio_vascular_aws_sm

2. PCA:
It is a unsupervised ML algorithm that performs Dimenstionality reduction while attempting at keeping the original information unchanged.
PCA works by trying to find new set of features called "components".

In Amazon SM PCA operates in two modes:

Regular: Works well with sparse data small manageable number of observations/features.
Randomized: Works well with large number of observations/features.

Hyperparameters of PCA:

feature_dim --> Input dimension.
mini_batch_size --> Number of rows in a mini-batch.
num_components --> The number of principal components to compute.
algorithm_mode --> Mode for computing the principal components.(regular or randomized)
extra_components --> As the value increases, the solution becomes more accurate but the runtime and memory consumption increase linearly. The default, -1, means the maximum of 10 and num_components. Valid for randomized mode only.

PCA can be used both in FIle mode and Pipe Mode.

3. XGBOOST ALgorithm (Classification)

The algorithm work by combining an ensemble of prediction from several weak model.


Hyperparameters of XGBOOST:



4. Confusion Matrix

TP: 
TN:
FP(Type 1 error):
FN(Type 2 Error):

Classification Accuracy:(TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)
Misclassification Rate:(FP+FN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)

5. Precision Recall F1 score

Precision: TP/TP+FP
Recall:TP/TP+FN

6. AUC-ROC Metrics

-   ROC curve is a metric that access the model ability to distinguish the model ability to distinguish between binary classification
-   Plotting TPR vs FPR

TPR --> sentitivity or Recall
FPR --> Probability pf false Alarm

7. Overfitting and underfitting
